## Generating Thumbnails

CVForge includes a thumbnail generation system for template previews. Here's how to generate thumbnails:

### Prerequisites for Thumbnail Generation
- Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running
- The application should be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`

### Generate Thumbnails

1. **Make sure the development server is running**
   ```bash
   cd client
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Run the thumbnail generation script**
   ```bash
   cd client
   pnpm generate-thumbnails
   ```

### Thumbnail Generation Process

The thumbnail generation script:
- Uses Puppeteer to take screenshots of each template
- Generates thumbnails at 400x500 resolution
- Saves thumbnails to `client/public/thumbnails/`
- Supports templates: classic, modern, minimalist, professional

### Customizing Thumbnail Generation

You can customize the thumbnail generation by modifying `client/scripts/generate-thumbnails.mjs`:

```javascript
// Customize viewport and thumbnail dimensions
const VIEWPORT_WIDTH = 800;
const VIEWPORT_HEIGHT = 1000;

```
